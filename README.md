# Week-Two-Assignment-Accessible-Image-Gallery
so far this assignemt became very stresful as I was behind a day
I was  unable to immediately catch up due to a major burn out 
so I had to take a day to recover. 
I amanged to catch up and found some cheetsheets thst helped.
I had plans to load all my photos from my trip to Berlin last year
but this was overly ambitious for the remaining time.
over all I will need to review the lessons and code to 
ensure I've grasped the concepts fully. 
I found this project really pushed me hard. 
It took me a lot of trial and error to get the buttons working. 
I managed to get tge pixtures selectable first then to enlarge them then to allow a user to close them.I added a video to the end too as a way to include the pictures i was umable
to upload in time.
I need to expand some work on this so that the galary begins with
the first picture. 
onward to the next one
