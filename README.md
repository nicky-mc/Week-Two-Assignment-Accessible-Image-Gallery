# Week-Two-Assignment-Accessible-Image-Gallery
so far this assignemt became very stressdul as i was behind a day
i was  unable to immediately catch up due to a major burn out 
so i had to take one of the days to recover. 
i amanged to catch up and found some cheetsheets thst helped.
i had plans to load all my photos from my trip to Berlin ladt year
but this was overly ambitious for the remaining time.
over all I will need to review the lessons and code to 
ensure I've grasped the concepts fully. 
I found this project really pushed me hard. 
It took me a lot of trail and error to get the buttons working. 
i managed to get tge pixtures selectible firet and then able to close them.
i added a video to the end too as a way to include the pictures i was umable
to upload in time.

onward to the next one
